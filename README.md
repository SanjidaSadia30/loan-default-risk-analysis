## Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes loan default risk across **255,347 loan records** to identify key patterns in borrower behavior, financial profiles, and default trends. The dataset was imported into **SQL Server** and connected to Power BI for analysis. The report consists of three interactive pages designed to help financial institutions make smarter lending decisions.

- Which borrower segments are most likely to default?
- How does employment type affect default rates?
- What is the relationship between credit score and loan amount?
- How have default rates changed over the years?
